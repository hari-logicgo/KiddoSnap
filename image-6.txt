Using the uploaded parent and child photos, generate a joyful outdoor portrait. Critically, maintain the child's exact facial features, skin tone, hair, and overall appearance from the uploaded child photo; preserve their original facial identity and realistic details precisely. The parent should be carrying the child on their shoulders, with the child positioned slightly forward and higher so their full, smiling face is clearly visible. The child should gently hold the parent’s cheeks with both hands, smiling happily. Capture bright, natural sunlight, warm tones, a soft depth of field, and a lush park-like background with greenery. Maintain natural skin tones, realistic lighting, and the feeling of a candid, joyful family moment.
