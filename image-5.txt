Using the uploaded parent and child photos, create a warm indoor portrait in the same style and mood as the reference image. Do not change their physical features, facial details, skin tone, hair, or overall appearance. Keep their likeness exactly the same.Show the parent sitting and gently holding the child on their lap while the child looks up at the parent and smiles. Use soft, warm indoor lighting with a cozy, natural home atmosphere. Include a softly blurred background, natural skin tones, gentle shadows, and a calm intimate moment between them.
