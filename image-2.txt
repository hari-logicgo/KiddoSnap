A cheerful, high-quality, realistic photograph. A parent is holding their toddler-aged child. The parent is smiling broadly and looking directly at the camera, clearly making a peace sign with one hand. The child is also smiling broadly and looking directly at the camera, clearly making a peace sign with one hand. Both their peace signs should be distinctly visible. Clean, simple, light-colored indoor background, soft natural lighting.
