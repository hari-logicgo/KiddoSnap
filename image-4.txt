Using the uploaded parent and child photos, generate a warm indoor portrait in the same style and mood as the reference image. Do not change their physical features, facial structure, skin tone, hair, or overall appearance. Keep their likeness exactly the same.Show the child hugging the parent tightly around the neck while both smile naturally. Use soft warm indoor lighting, a shallow depth of field, and a cozy home atmosphere with a softly blurred background. Capture a close, intimate, joyful moment with natural skin tones, gentle highlights, and realistic shadows.
